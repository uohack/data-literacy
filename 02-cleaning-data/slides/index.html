					<h3>Example</h3>
					<aside class="notes">
						<div>So, this is a very common task, you are assigned to analyze a proposed budget, in this case, the City of Eugene. So you get the proposed budget, a public document and it's 209 pages long. I'm going to give you a huge hint, the first important step to analyzing any budget is to figure out how the money is distributed at the top level. From there you can dig down as needed. In this case you can find that on page 62 of the PDF, although it's labeled as page 56. Your task is to figure out if there is anything interest at the top level of this budget.</div>
